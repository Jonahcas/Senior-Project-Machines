Iorik
---------
Desktop: Folder with work notes, and fake clients and assignments.
Documents: Company documents that detail Iorik's current assignment, as well as copies of emails about something suspicious going on in upper management concerning the dissapearence of Tr1@ge.
Downloads: More company documents, and a series of folders/sub-folders, having the player learn directory traversal and how to look closely at file permissions. Through this puzzle of directory traversal,
	   the player will find an insecure Bash Script that allows Root Access (perhaps a CRON job that runs). This allows the ability to jump machines and progress the story, or go to the optional machine).

Kirjava (Accessed through Iorik, required machine).
----------
Desktop: More work notes, and fake client works and assignments. 
Documents: Company documents detailint Kirjava's current assignment. Unlike Iorik, the required "flags" aren't in this folder.
Downloads: In downloads, there's a way to get to the next level of machines, which is TBD.

Pantalaimon (Accessed through Iorik, optional machine).
-------------
Desktop: Work notes, as usual. Copies of emails between Pan and Kirjava.
Documents: Company documents as usual.
Downloads: In downloads, there's a small REDIS database filled with clients and the employees assigned to each. One of these employee "values" has the password for it attached. 
	   This will be useful for a password-protected file, if I can get it working, in the next level of machines.
